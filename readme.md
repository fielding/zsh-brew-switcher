## üì¶ Installation
Install with your zsh plugin manager of choice.

### with [zplug](https://github.com/zplug/zplug)
```
zplug fielding/zsh-brew-switcher, from:github, at:main
```

## üöÄ Usage
Simply run a zsh shell with a specified architecture the plugin will automatically switch to the correct brew installation for you based on the arch, `$(arch)`, specified.

## Extra
I planned to make a plugin to enable viewing the arch when it was x86_64 in a spaceship prompt, but somebody took care of it already. I recommend using these together, [spaceship-arch](https://github.com/windwhinny/spaceship-arch) 
## üç∫ Homebrew Paths
On ARM64, Homebrew is installed to `/opt/homebrew` and the executable path is `/opt/homebrew/bin/brew`.

On X86_64, Homebrew is installed to `/usr/local/Homebrew` and the executable path is `/usr/local/bin/brew`.

The plugin handles running `brew shellenv` from the correct brew executable automatically based on the specified architecture.
